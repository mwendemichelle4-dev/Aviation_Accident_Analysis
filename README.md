# Aviation_Accident_Analysis

# Project Overview

This project seeks to analyze aviation accident and incident data to identify the potential risks associated with different aircraft types, with the goal of guiding the company in determining which aircraft are safest and most suitable for entry into the aviation industry. It is being carried out as part of the companyâ€™s strategy to diversify its portfolio into the purchase and operation of airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises, ensuring investments are made in low-risk options. The key stakeholders include the head of the aviation division, senior management responsible for diversification, and the data analytics team conducting the study. Set within the aviation industry, the project emphasizes safety, risk management, and evidence-based decision-making to support strategic aircraft acquisition.

# Problem Statement
The company is planning to expand into the aviation industry by purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private use. However, management lacks adequate knowledge of the risks associated with different aircraft types, which poses a challenge in making safe and cost-effective investment decisions. Without a data-driven approach to understand accident patterns, damage severity, and injury outcomes, the company risks purchasing high-risk aircraft that could increase operational costs, insurance liabilities, and safety concerns.

# Business Objectives
* To assess the relationship between accident severity and aircraft characteristics

* To determine the impact of flight purpose on accident outcomes

* To analyze the effect of weather conditions on accident severity

* To examine accident patterns across different phases of flight

* To rank aircraft makes and models based on safety outcomes

# Data Mining Goals
Clean and prepare aviation accident and incident data for analysis.

Analyze patterns across variables such as aircraft damage, injury severity, and investigation type.

Visualize findings to clearly communicate risk levels associated with different aircraft categories.

# Success Criteria
Deliver clear, data-driven recommendations on which aircraft types present the lowest risk.

Ensure that the aviation division has evidence-based insights to guide purchasing decisions.

Enable the company to enter the aviation industry with confidence by mitigating safety and financial risks.

# Conclusions and Recommendations

The analysis of aviation accident data shows that overall safety in the industry has steadily improved since the early 1980s, reflecting advancements in aircraft technology, regulatory frameworks, and pilot training programs. However, risks still exist, particularly during critical phases of flight such as takeoff and cruise, and during high-activity periods like summer months and weekends. While most accidents are non-fatal, they often result in substantial or total aircraft damage, which can translate into significant financial losses for operators.

A closer look at accident distribution reveals that factory-built, certified aircraft dominate accident records, largely because they make up the majority of aircraft in operation. Certain models, such as the Cessna 152 and Cessna 172 series, appear frequently in accident data, but this is likely influenced by their widespread use in training and recreational aviation rather than inherent design flaws. In contrast, amateur-built aircraft are less represented, but their smaller population makes it difficult to assess their risk profile in comparison.

These findings highlight the importance of operational discipline. A significant number of accidents occur during personal and recreational flights, while structured commercial operations tend to demonstrate stronger safety performance. Accidents in clear weather further suggest that human error, rather than environmental conditions, is often the root cause. Therefore, for a company entering the aviation industry, focusing on certified, factory-built aircraft and prioritizing structured, commercial use cases is more sustainable and aligns better with safety and business objectives.

Based on these insights, the company is recommended to invest in certified, factory-built aircraft with proven safety records, supported by comprehensive insurance and rigorous maintenance schedules to mitigate the financial impact of accidents. Strong pilot training and error-reduction programs should be emphasized, particularly targeting critical flight phases where risk is greatest. Seasonal and weekend risk patterns also call for heightened operational vigilance during these periods. By adopting these measures, the company can minimize risks while establishing a safe and competitive presence in the aviation industry.
