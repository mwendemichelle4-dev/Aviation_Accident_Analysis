# Aviation_Accident_Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify the lowest-risk aircraft for a company expanding into the aviation industry. Using data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, the study highlights accident trends, aircraft risk profiles, and key contributing factors. The goal is to provide actionable insights that guide investment decisions on which aircraft models are safest and most cost-effective for commercial and private operations.


# Problem Statement
The company is planning to expand into the aviation industry by purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private use. However, management lacks adequate knowledge of the risks associated with different aircraft types, which poses a challenge in making safe and cost-effective investment decisions. Without a data-driven approach to understand accident patterns, damage severity, and injury outcomes, the company risks purchasing high-risk aircraft that could increase operational costs, insurance liabilities, and safety concerns.

# Data
The analysis uses the Aviation Accident dataset from [GitHub](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template.git)
, containing over 90,000 records from 1948–2020. For this study, data from 1982 onwards was used, focusing on key variables such as injury severity, aircraft damage, make/model, and engine type to assess accident risks and support investment decisions

# Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis with grouping, aggregation, and visualization to identify accident patterns by aircraft type, injury severity, flight purpose, and weather. Bar charts and line plots highlight key insights, supporting data-driven recommendations for safer aircraft investment.


# Results
* **Aviation Safety Trends**

Over the past 40 years, aviation safety has improved significantly. All injury categories, especially fatalities, have declined—reflecting advances in aircraft technology, stricter regulations, and better emergency response systems.

* **Weather Conditions**

Most accidents occur under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)—favorable weather for flying. This may be linked to the higher number of flights taking place in good weather rather than poor conditions.

* **Aircraft Models & Engines**

Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Cessna 172N account for a high number of accidents—likely due to their widespread use.

A strong link exists between engine type and accident frequency, though this may reflect how many are in active operation rather than higher risk.

* **Flight Purpose**

Personal and recreational flights show higher accident rates.

Commercial flights demonstrate stronger safety performance, likely due to structured operations, better-trained crews, and tighter regulations.

# Conclusions and Recommendations

The analysis shows that aviation safety has steadily improved since the 1980s, but risks remain during critical phases such as takeoff and cruise, as well as in high-activity periods like summer months and weekends. Most accidents are non-fatal but result in costly aircraft damage.

Factory-built, certified aircraft dominate accident records mainly due to their prevalence, with popular models like the Cessna 152 and 172 appearing often in training and recreational incidents. Accidents occurring in clear weather highlight human error and operational discipline as major contributing factors.

For a company entering aviation, the safest strategy is to invest in certified, factory-built aircraft with strong safety records, supported by strict maintenance, comprehensive insurance, and robust pilot training programs. Emphasis should be placed on minimizing human error and strengthening operational protocols, especially during high-risk flight phases.where risk is greatest. Seasonal and weekend risk patterns also call for heightened operational vigilance during these periods. By adopting these measures, the company can minimize risks while establishing a safe and competitive presence in the aviation industry.

# Next Steps
Collect more data on variables like Aircraft type. That way it will be easier to determine the type of aircrafts involved in most accidents and why.
