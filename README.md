# Aviation_Accident_Analysis

# Project Overview

This project seeks to analyze aviation accident and incident data to identify the potential risks associated with different aircraft types, with the goal of guiding the company in determining which aircraft are safest and most suitable for entry into the aviation industry. It is being carried out as part of the companyâ€™s strategy to diversify its portfolio into the purchase and operation of airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises, ensuring investments are made in low-risk options. The key stakeholders include the head of the aviation division, senior management responsible for diversification, and the data analytics team conducting the study. Set within the aviation industry, the project emphasizes safety, risk management, and evidence-based decision-making to support strategic aircraft acquisition.

# Problem Statement
The company is planning to expand into the aviation industry by purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private use. However, management lacks adequate knowledge of the risks associated with different aircraft types, which poses a challenge in making safe and cost-effective investment decisions. Without a data-driven approach to understand accident patterns, damage severity, and injury outcomes, the company risks purchasing high-risk aircraft that could increase operational costs, insurance liabilities, and safety concerns.

# Data
For the analysis we will be using the Aviation-Accident csv dataset from (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template.git).

# Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis, including trend analysis over time and categorical comparisons. Grouping and aggregation were applied to identify accident patterns by aircraft type, injury severity, flight purpose, and weather conditions. Visualization techniques such as bar charts and line plots were used to highlight key insights, providing a clear overview of aviation accident risks and supporting data-driven recommendations for safer aircraft investment.

# Results

The graph suggests significant progress in aviation safety over the past 40 years. The decrease in all injury types, especially fatalities, points toward better aircraft technology, stricter regulations, and improved emergency response.

Most accidents happen in  Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) which is more favourable condition for pilots and flights. This could be due to a high number of flights when the weather is favourable. Also most accidents take place during take off and cruise.

Cessna152, Cessna172, Cessna172N invoved in more accidents. This might be due to the populariy of these models but more investigation must be conducted.
There also seems to be a strong connection between engine type and number of accidents. But again, this can be because of high number of them being in operation

 A significant number of accidents occur during personal and recreational flights, while structured commercial operations tend to demonstrate stronger safety performance.

# Conclusions and Recommendations

The analysis shows that aviation safety has steadily improved since the 1980s, but risks remain during critical phases such as takeoff and cruise, as well as in high-activity periods like summer months and weekends. Most accidents are non-fatal but result in costly aircraft damage.

Factory-built, certified aircraft dominate accident records mainly due to their prevalence, with popular models like the Cessna 152 and 172 appearing often in training and recreational incidents. Accidents occurring in clear weather highlight human error and operational discipline as major contributing factors.

For a company entering aviation, the safest strategy is to invest in certified, factory-built aircraft with strong safety records, supported by strict maintenance, comprehensive insurance, and robust pilot training programs. Emphasis should be placed on minimizing human error and strengthening operational protocols, especially during high-risk flight phases.where risk is greatest. Seasonal and weekend risk patterns also call for heightened operational vigilance during these periods. By adopting these measures, the company can minimize risks while establishing a safe and competitive presence in the aviation industry.

# Next Steps
Collect more data on variables like Aircraft type. That way it will be easier to determine the type of aircrafts involved in most accidents and why.
