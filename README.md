# Aviation_Accident_Analysis

# Project Overview

This project seeks to analyze aviation accident and incident data to identify the potential risks associated with different aircraft types, with the goal of guiding the company in determining which aircraft are safest and most suitable for entry into the aviation industry. It is being carried out as part of the companyâ€™s strategy to diversify its portfolio into the purchase and operation of airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises, ensuring investments are made in low-risk options. The key stakeholders include the head of the aviation division, senior management responsible for diversification, and the data analytics team conducting the study. Set within the aviation industry, the project emphasizes safety, risk management, and evidence-based decision-making to support strategic aircraft acquisition.

# Problem Statement
The company is planning to expand into the aviation industry by purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private use. However, management lacks adequate knowledge of the risks associated with different aircraft types, which poses a challenge in making safe and cost-effective investment decisions. Without a data-driven approach to understand accident patterns, damage severity, and injury outcomes, the company risks purchasing high-risk aircraft that could increase operational costs, insurance liabilities, and safety concerns.

# Business Objectives
Identify the aircraft types with the lowest operational risks.

Provide actionable insights to support safe and strategic purchasing decisions.

Minimize long-term costs associated with accidents, insurance, and maintenance by selecting safer aircraft.

# Data Mining Goals
Clean and prepare aviation accident and incident data for analysis.

Analyze patterns across variables such as aircraft damage, injury severity, and investigation type.

Visualize findings to clearly communicate risk levels associated with different aircraft categories.

# Success Criteria
Deliver clear, data-driven recommendations on which aircraft types present the lowest risk.

Ensure that the aviation division has evidence-based insights to guide purchasing decisions.

Enable the company to enter the aviation industry with confidence by mitigating safety and financial risks.
